**_Less of “Whatcha you doin?” and more of “just doing”!_**

## 💭 Motivation

Have you ever come across these thoughts?

-   _“Man, I am losing track of how I am spending my time? It’s like I am doing everything but still nothing.”_
-   _“What have I learnt, what I want to, what I will - it's just a mess…”_
-   _“I wonder what everybody else is upto these days?”_
-   _“I wonder what my college senior did right in his fifth sem?”_
-   _“Where can I find and approach people to talk about my projects, the technologies I have explored and want to explore? Like how would I know if someone would be interested?”_

It often comes to our mind that what other people are doing or learning, especially our colleagues or friends. More than that what is more troubling is the fact that often we get overwhelmed by things happening around us. Days are passing by and it is not as if you are not indulging in some fun and good stuff but still you know you can do more or could have done more and then you think can you, actually?

**_What is required is better organisation and management of your activities and priorities plus, a right direction and healthy mix of attitude and motivation to help you achieve productivity, growth and peace of mind._**

## 💡 The idea

Whatcha is a place where people can log their daily activities and share what they are working on, what they are learning and what they are exploring. The idea is to boost productivity through sharing your work with the community and through noticing what others are investing their time and effort in. Documenting and sharing your exploits shall help others but much more than it’s for you to reflect on your thoughts and actions and at the same time learn and explore.

## 🤩 What makes it special?

There a few things which form the USP of this project, because of it

-   there is no need for the “_whatcha you doin?_” question,
-   you actually have a platform that focuses on the process,
-   you post stuff that you are doing - that means you share your work and at the same time reflect on your activities and thoughts,
-   you learn from others’ work and can connect with them for learning more,
-   and you have an awesome community with a motivated group of people.

**_This is not a platform which focuses on building a social media network, rather it focuses on building individuals and communities._**
