# Whatcha

**_Enough of “What are you doing?” and more of “just doing”!_**

## Motivation

It often comes to our mind that what other people are doing or learning, especially our colleagues or friends. More than that what is more troubling is the fact that often we get overwhelmed by things happening around us. Days are passing by and it is not as if you are not indulging in some fun and good stuff but still you know you can do more or could have done more and then you think can you actually?

**What is required is better organisation and management of your activities and priorities plus, a right direction and healthy mix of attitude and motivation to help you achieve productivity, growth and peace of mind.**

## The idea

whatcha is a place where people can log their daily activities and share what they are working on, what they are learning and what they are exploring.

The idea is to boost productivity through sharing your work with the community and through noticing what others are investing their time and effort in.

Documenting and sharing your exploits shall help others but much more than it’s for you to reflect on your thoughts and actions and at the same time learn and explore.

So enough of “What are you doing?” and more of “just doing”!
